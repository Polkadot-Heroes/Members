# Rookies

This README showcases all the people who have made it as Rookies into the Heroes program!

All of our program members start as a Rookie. Start by adding your profile as a Rookie to begin with and then be sure to [nominate yourself to be a Hero](https://github.com/Polkadot-Heroes/Members/issues/new/choose) when you feel ready.

You can read the [Heroes Review Criteria and Scoring Matrix Guidelines](../Heroes_Review_Criteria.md) to learn more about the Hero review process.
